# Structuring planet data

In this table assessment, I marked up some data on the planets in our solar system, and structured it into an HTML table.

## The repository contains:

`README.md`: This is the assessment description file, where I should briefly describe about the files of this assessment.

`index.html`: This is the main and only web page for the website of this assessment. My goal here is to obtain an easy-to-follow set of data to look up facts and figures about the planets from a planets-data.txt file and present it so everyone can access and understand it easily. As it is a tabular data an HTML data table can be the right choice.

`style.css`: This is the main and only css file to make the look of the table more meaningful and obvious.
